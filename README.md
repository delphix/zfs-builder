# Docker ZFS Builder

This image is designed to build ZFS on Linux for any kernel, even those that
are different from the one running on the host system. To build the latest ZFS
for the currently running system, run:

    $ docker run -v /:/build -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock delphix/zfs-builder:latest

The `/var/run/docker.sock` mount is currently only required for linuxkit builds,
as the canonical source for the linuxkit kernel is in docker images, which require
docker privileges to run.

To configure the container to buld for a kernel other than the running system,
the following configuration options are available:

 * `-e ZFS_VERSION=zfs-0.8.0` - Version of ZFS to build. Must correspond to a tag or a
   commit hash in the `zfsonlinux/zfs` github repository. Defaults to the
   latest tag.
 * `-e KERNEL_RELEASE=4.9.125-linuxkit` - Version of the kernel interfaces to use,
   from `uname -r`. If the variant (e.g. "linuxkit") is known, then we will pull
   kernel headers via the distro-specific mechanisms. Otherwise, we will try to
   use the version published on `kernel.org`, though it's possible that the system
   is running with unknown patches to those sources. Defaults to `uname -r`. If
   you are building for a distro for the first time, you might want to submit
   a pull request to grab the appropriate kernel source.
 * `-e KERNEL_UNAME=...` - Complete `uname -a` output identifying the kernel. For
   some distros (e.g. Ubuntu), the variant is much easier to identify from the
   full uname output, as there's not a constant string in `uname -r` output.
 * `-v path:/config` - Kernel configuration to use for building the kernel.
   Must contain a single file, `config.gz`. Defaults to `/proc/config.gz`. This is
   only needed in cases where we need to build the kernel from scratch; if we
   can get pre-built kernel headers and objects via a distro-specific mechanism,
   then we won't need this kernel configuration.
 * `-v path:/build` - Output where ZFS binaries (kernel modules and userland
   tools) will be placed, using their absolute path (e.g. `/build/sbin/zfs`)

## Additional configuration

While not the primary configuration parameters, the following options can also
be used:

 * `-v path:/src/zfs` - Specify the ZFS source to use. If this is present, then
   the builder will skip cloning and checking out the ZFS source, and use what's
   here instead. `ZFS_VERSION` is ignored in this case.
 * `-v path:/src/linux` - Like above, if this is present then the builder will
   skip downloading the kernel source. It will still copy `config.gz` unless
   `.config` is already present in this directory. `KERNEL_RELEASE` is ignored
   in this case. 
 * `-e ZFS_CONFIG=all|user|kernel` - Control what ZFS binaries to build,
   defaults to `all`. If `user` is specified, then the kernel build steps are
   skipped.

This builder only works with ZFS version 0.8.0 or later, as the spl repository
has been merged and no longer needs to be built separately.

## Supported distros

The following distro-specific source mechanisms have been implemented:

  * Linuxkit - Pulls source from the `linuxkit/kernel` docker image
  * Ubuntu - Pull kernel headers, modules, and source via `apt`j

In the event that the distro-specific mechanism cannot be determined, it will
attempt to use vanilla sources from `kernel.org`, but it may or may not work
depending on what distro-specific patches have been applied.

## How it works

ZFS, like other kernel modules, has a dependency on the interfaces of the
running kernel. Normally, this is built against the currently running kernel.
But this creates challenges for users to always install all the requisite build
tools and find the requisite kernel source, not to mention cases where you
might want to build packages for a kernel other than the one you are currently
running (such as part of an automated process using standard build machines).

To accomplish this, the ZFS builder does the following:

 1. Clone `https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs.git` into `/src/zfs` and
    checks out the appropriate tag (unless `/src/zfs` already exists)
 2. Build the kernel, if necessary. First check the kernel release variant and,
    if a known distro, download pre-built kernel headers, objects, and/or source
    through distro-specific means. Otherwise get the source from `www.kernel.org`.
    If we need to build the kernel (vs. using a pre-built copy), copy the `config.gz`
    configuration to `/src/kernel/.config` and build the kernel.
 3. Build `/src/zfs`
 4. Copy the resulting binaries to `/build`
